# Jarvis

Description: Jarvis helps people find lower cost alternatives to hospital procedures in their area.  If they’re willing to drive further to have their procedure, we can find the lowest cost in a wider area, taking into account driving costs.

Motivation: Health care costs can vary widely between providers with little transparency. Jarvis helps to take some of the guesswork out of the cost of major procedures.

Results: We used a database from healthdata.gov that outlines costs of procedures in hospitals across the country and present those to members in an easy to understand format.
